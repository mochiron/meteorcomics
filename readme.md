# CSS comic strip
* Masonry like for vignettes
* Positioning of characters
* Positioning of dialog bubbles
* HTML support for dialog bubbles

# TODO
* "Slideshow" mode
* Masks and layers (using css sprites) or actors' poses
* Actually use meteor for something (e.g. saving the strips in MongoDB and using DDP for notifications and updates)
